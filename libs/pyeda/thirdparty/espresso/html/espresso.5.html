espresso - input file format for espresso(1OCTTOOLS)
<A NAME="lbAC">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<I>Espresso</I> accepts as input a two-level description of a Boolean
function.  This is described as a character matrix with keywords
embedded in the input to specify the size of the matrix and
the logical format of the input function.
Programs exist to translate a set of equations into
this format (e.g., eqntott(1OCTTOOLS), bdsyn(1OCTTOOLS), eqntopla(1OCTTOOLS)).
This manual page refers to Version 2.3 of <I>Espresso</I>.
<P>

Comments are allowed within the input by placing a
pound sign (#) as the first character on a line.
Comments and unrecognized keywords are passed
directly from the input file to standard output.  Any white-space
(blanks, tabs, etc.), except when used as a delimiter in an embedded
command, is ignored.  It is generally assumed that the <FONT SIZE="-1">PLA</FONT> is specified
such that each row of the <FONT SIZE="-1">PLA</FONT> fits on a single line in the input file.
<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>KEYWORDS</H2>

The following keywords are recognized by <I>espresso</I>.
The list shows
the probable order of the keywords in a <FONT SIZE="-1">PLA</FONT> description.
[d] denotes a decimal number and [s] denotes a
text string.  The minimum required set of 
keywords is <B>.i</B> and <B>.o</B> for binary-valued 
functions, or <B>.mv</B> for multiple-valued functions.
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>.i [d]</B>

<DD>
Specifies the number of input variables.
<DT><B>.o [d]</B>

<DD>
Specifies the number of output functions.
<DT><B>.mv [num_var] [num_binary_var] [d1] . . . [dn]</B>

<DD>
Specifies the number of variables (num_var), the number of binary variables
(num_binary_var),
and the size of each of the multiple-valued variables (d1 through dn).
<DT><B>.ilb [s1] [s2] . . . [sn]</B>

<DD>
Gives the names of the binary valued variables.
This must come after <B>.i</B> and <B>.o</B> (or after <B>.mv</B>).
There must be as many tokens following the keyword as there
are input variables.
<DT><B>.ob [s1] [s2] . . . [sn]</B>

<DD>
Gives the names of the output functions.
This must come after <B>.i</B> and <B>.o</B> (or after <B>.mv</B>).
There must be as many tokens following the keyword as there
are output variables.
<DT><B>.label var=[d] [s1] [s2] ...</B>

<DD>
Specifies the names of the parts of a multiple-valued variable.
This must come after <B>.mv</B>.
There must be as many tokens following the keyword as there
are parts for this variable.  Note that the variables are numbered
starting from 0.
<DT><B>.type [s]</B>

<DD>
Sets the logical interpretation of the character matrix as
described below under &quot;Logical Description of a <FONT SIZE="-1">PLA</FONT>&quot;.  This keyword
must come before any product terms.
[s] is one of f, r, fd, fr, dr, or fdr.
<DT><B>.phase [s]</B>

<DD>
[s] is a string of as many 0's or 1's as there are output
functions.  It specifies which polarity of each output function
should be used for the minimization (a 1 specifies that the
<FONT SIZE="-1">ON</FONT>-set of the corresponding output function should be used, and
a 0 specifies that the <FONT SIZE="-1">OFF</FONT>-set of the corresponding output function
should be minimized).
<DT><B>.pair [d]</B>

<DD>
Specifies the number of pairs of variables which will be paired together
using two-bit decoders.
The rest of the
line contains pairs of numbers which specify the binary variables
of the <FONT SIZE="-1">PLA</FONT> which
will be paired together.  The binary variables are numbered
starting with 0.  The <FONT SIZE="-1">PLA</FONT> will be reshaped so that any unpaired binary
variables occupy the leftmost part of the array, then the paired
multiple-valued columns, and finally any multiple-valued variables.
If the labels have been specified using <B>.ilb</B>, then the variable
names may be used instead of the column number.
<DT><B>.symbolic [s0] [s1] . . . [sn] ; [t0] [t1]  . . . [tm] ;</B>

<DD>
Specifies that the binary-valued variables named [s0] thru [sn] are to be
considered as a single multiple-valued variable.
Variable [s0] is considered the most significant bit, [s1] the next
most significant, and [sn] is the least significant bit.
This creates a variable
with 2**n parts corresponding to the decodes of the binary-valued variables.
The keywords [t0] thru [tm] provide the labels for each decode of
[s0] thru [sn].  ([t0] corresponds to a value of 00...00,
[t1] is the value 00...01, etc.).
The binary-variables may be
identified by column number, or by variable name when <B>.ilb</B> is used.
The binary-variables are removed from the function after the
multiple-valued variable is created.
<DT><B>.symbolic-output [s0] [s1] . . . [sn] ; [t0] [t1] . . . [tm] ;</B>

<DD>
Specifies that the output functions [s0] ... [sn] are to be considered
as a single symbolic output.  This creates 2**n more output variables
corresponding to the possible values of the outputs.
The outputs may be identified by number (starting from 0),
or by variable name when <B>.ob</B> is used.
The outputs are removed from the function after the new
set of outputs is created.
<DT><B>.kiss</B>

<DD>
Sets up for a <I>kiss</I>-style minimization.
<DT><B>.p [d]</B>

<DD>
Specifies the number of product terms.  The product terms (one per line)
follow immediately after this keyword.  Actually, this line is ignored,
and the &quot;.e&quot;, &quot;.end&quot;,
or the end of the file indicate the end of the input description.
<DT><B>.e (.end)</B>

<DD>
Optionally marks the end of the <FONT SIZE="-1">PLA</FONT> description.

<H2>LOGICAL DESCRIPTION OF A PLA</H2>

When we speak of the <FONT SIZE="-1">ON</FONT>-set of a
Boolean function, we mean those minterms which
imply the function value is a 1.
Likewise, the <FONT SIZE="-1">OFF</FONT>-set are those terms
which imply the function is a 0, and the <FONT SIZE="-1">DC</FONT>-set (don't care set)
are those terms for which the function is unspecified.
A function is
completely described by providing
its <FONT SIZE="-1">ON</FONT>-set, <FONT SIZE="-1">OFF</FONT>-set and <FONT SIZE="-1">DC</FONT>-set.
Note that all minterms lie in the union of the <FONT SIZE="-1">ON</FONT>-set, <FONT SIZE="-1">OFF</FONT>-set
and <FONT SIZE="-1">DC</FONT>-set, and
that the <FONT SIZE="-1">ON</FONT>-set, <FONT SIZE="-1">OFF</FONT>-set and <FONT SIZE="-1">DC</FONT>-set share no minterms.
<P>

The purpose of the
<I>espresso</I>

minimization program is to find a logically
equivalent set of product-terms to
represent the <FONT SIZE="-1">ON</FONT>-set and optionally minterms
which lie in the <FONT SIZE="-1">DC</FONT>-set, without containing any minterms of the <FONT SIZE="-1">OFF</FONT>-set.
<P>

A Boolean function
can be described in one of the
following ways:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>1)<DD>
By providing the <FONT SIZE="-1">ON</FONT>-set.  In this case,
<I>espresso</I>

computes the <FONT SIZE="-1">OFF</FONT>-set as the complement of the <FONT SIZE="-1">ON</FONT>-set and the <FONT SIZE="-1">DC</FONT>-set is empty.
This is indicated with the keyword <B>.type f</B>
in the input file.
<DT>2)<DD>
By providing the <FONT SIZE="-1">ON</FONT>-set and <FONT SIZE="-1">DC</FONT>-set.  In this case,
<I>espresso</I>

computes the <FONT SIZE="-1">OFF</FONT>-set as the complement of the union
of the <FONT SIZE="-1">ON</FONT>-set and the <FONT SIZE="-1">DC</FONT>-set.  If any minterm belongs to both the
<FONT SIZE="-1">ON</FONT>-set and <FONT SIZE="-1">DC</FONT>-set, then it is considered a don't care and may be removed
from the <FONT SIZE="-1">ON</FONT>-set during the minimization process.
This is indicated with the keyword <B>.type fd</B>
in the input file.
<DT>3)<DD>
By providing the <FONT SIZE="-1">ON</FONT>-set and <FONT SIZE="-1">OFF</FONT>-set.  In this case,
<I>espresso</I>

computes the <FONT SIZE="-1">DC</FONT>-set as the complement of the union
of the <FONT SIZE="-1">ON</FONT>-set and the <FONT SIZE="-1">OFF</FONT>-set.  It is an error for
any minterm to belong to both the <FONT SIZE="-1">ON</FONT>-set and <FONT SIZE="-1">OFF</FONT>-set.
This error may not be detected during the
minimization, but it can be checked
with the subprogram &quot;-Dcheck&quot; which will
check the consistency of a function.
This is indicated with the keyword <B>.type fr</B> in the input file.
<DT>4)<DD>
By providing the <FONT SIZE="-1">ON</FONT>-set, <FONT SIZE="-1">OFF</FONT>-set and <FONT SIZE="-1">DC</FONT>-set.
This is indicated with the keyword <B>.type fdr</B>
in the input file.
</DL>
<P>

If at all possible,
<I>espresso</I>

should be given the <FONT SIZE="-1">DC</FONT>-set (either
implicitly or explicitly) in order to improve the results of the
minimization.
<P>

A term is represented by a &quot;cube&quot; which can be considered either
a compact representation of an algebraic product term which implies
the function value is a 1,
or as a representation of a row in a <FONT SIZE="-1">PLA</FONT> which
implements the term.
A cube has an input part which corresponds to the input plane of
a <FONT SIZE="-1">PLA</FONT>, and an output part which corresponds to the output plane
of a <FONT SIZE="-1">PLA</FONT> (for the multiple-valued case, see below).
<P>
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SYMBOLS IN THE PLA MATRIX AND THEIR INTERPRETATION</H2>

<P>

Each position in the input plane corresponds to an input variable
where a 0 implies the corresponding input literal appears
complemented in the product term, a 1 implies the input literal
appears uncomplemented in the product term, and -
implies the input literal does not appear in the product term.
<P>

With type <I>f</I>, for each output,
a <B>1</B> means this product term belongs to the <FONT SIZE="-1">ON</FONT>-set, and
a <B>0</B> or <B>-</B> means this product term has no meaning for the value
of this function.
This type corresponds to an actual <FONT SIZE="-1">PLA</FONT> where 
only the <FONT SIZE="-1">ON</FONT>-set is actually implemented.
<P>

With type <I>fd</I> (the default), for each output,
a <B>1</B> means this product term belongs to the <FONT SIZE="-1">ON</FONT>-set,
a <B>0</B> means this product term
has no meaning for the value of this function,
and a <B>-</B> implies this product term belongs to the <FONT SIZE="-1">DC</FONT>-set.
<P>

With type <I>fr</I>, for each output,
a <B>1</B> means this product term belongs to the <FONT SIZE="-1">ON</FONT>-set,
a <B>0</B> means this product term belongs to the <FONT SIZE="-1">OFF</FONT>-set,
and a <B>-</B> means this product term has no meaning for the value
of this function.
<P>

With type <I>fdr</I>, for each output,
a <B>1</B> means this product term belongs to the <FONT SIZE="-1">ON</FONT>-set,
a <B>0</B> means this product term belongs to the <FONT SIZE="-1">OFF</FONT>-set,
a <B>-</B> means this product term belongs to the <FONT SIZE="-1">DC</FONT>-set,
and a <B>~</B> implies this product term has no meaning for the value of this
function.
<P>

Note that regardless of the type of <FONT SIZE="-1">PLA</FONT>,
a <B>~</B> implies the product term has no meaning for the value of this
function.  <B>2</B> is allowed as a synonym for <B>-</B>, <B>4</B> is allowed
for <B>1</B>,  and <B>3</B> is allowed for <B>~</B>.
<P>

<H2>MULTIPLE-VALUED FUNCTIONS</H2>

Espresso will also minimize multiple-valued Boolean functions.  There
can be an arbitrary number of multiple-valued variables, and each can be
of a different size.  If there are also binary-valued variables, they
should be given as the first variables on the line (for ease of description).
Of course, it is always possible to place them anywhere on the
line as a two-valued multiple-valued variable.
The function size is described by the 
embedded option <B>.mv</B> rather than <B>.i</B> and <B>.o</B>.
<P>

A multiple-output binary function with <I>ni</I> 
inputs and <I>no</I> outputs would be specified as <B>.mv</B> <I>ni+1 ni no</I>.
<B>.mv</B>

cannot be used with
either <B>.i</B> or <B>.o</B> - use one or the other 
to specify the function size.
<P>

The binary variables are given as described above.  Each of the
multiple-valued variables are given as a bit-vector of <B>0</B> and <B>1</B>
which have their usual meaning for multiple-valued functions.
The last multiple-valued variable (also called the output)
is interpreted as described above for the output (to split the
function into an <FONT SIZE="-1">ON</FONT>-set, <FONT SIZE="-1">OFF</FONT>-set and <FONT SIZE="-1">DC</FONT>-set).
A vertical bar <B>|</B> may be used to separate the multiple-valued
fields in the input file.
<P>

If the size of the multiple-valued field is less than zero, than
a symbolic field is interpreted from the input file.  The absolute value
of the size specifies the maximum number of unique symbolic labels which
are expected in this column.  The symbolic labels are white-space
delimited strings of characters.
<P>

To perform a <I>kiss</I>-style encoding problem, the keyword <B>.kiss</B>
should be included in the file.
The third to last variable on the
input file must be the symbolic &quot;present state&quot;, and the second to last
variable
must be the &quot;next state&quot;.  As always, the last variable is the output.
The symbolic &quot;next state&quot; will be hacked to be actually part of the output.

<H2>EXAMPLE #1</H2>

A two-bit adder which takes in two 2-bit operands and produces a 3-bit
result can be described completely in minterms as:
<P>
<PRE>
          # 2-bit by 2-bit binary adder (with no carry input)
          .i 4
          .o 3

          1110  101
          1111  110
</PRE>

<P>
<P>

It is also possible to specify some extra options, such as:
<P>

<PRE>
          # 2-bit by 2-bit binary adder (with no carry input)
          .i 4
          .o 3
          .ilb a1 a0 b1 b0
          .ob s2 s1 s0
          .pair 2 (a1 b1) (a0 b0)
          .phase 011
          0000  000
          0001  001
          0010  010
                .
                .
                .
          1111  110
          .e
</PRE>


<P>
<P>

The option <I>.pair</I> indicates that the first binary-valued
variable should be paired with the third binary-valued variable, and
that the second variable should be paired with the fourth variable.
The function will then be mapped into an equivalent multiple-valued
minimization problem.
<P>
The option <I>.phase</I> indicates that the positive-phase
should be used for the second and third outputs, and that
the negative phase should be used for the first output.
