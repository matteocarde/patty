<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

<B>espresso</B>

[<I>options</I>] [<I>file</I>]
<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>

<I>Espresso</I>

takes as input a two-level representation of a
two-valued (or multiple-valued) Boolean function, and produces a
minimal equivalent representation.  The algorithms used are new and
represent an advance in both speed and optimality of solution in
heuristic Boolean minimization.
<P>

<I>Espresso</I>

reads the <I>file</I> provided (or standard input if no files
are specified), performs the minimization, and writes the minimized result to
standard output.
<I>Espresso</I>

automatically verifies that the minimized function
is equivalent to the original function.
Options allow for using an exact minimization algorithm, for
choosing an optimal phase assignment for the output functions, and
for choosing an optimal assignment of the inputs to input decoders.
<P>

The default input and output file formats are compatible with the
Berkeley standard format for the physical description of a <FONT SIZE="-1">PLA</FONT>.  The
input format is described in detail in <A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?5+espresso">espresso</A>(5).  Note that the
input file is a <I>logical</I> representation of
a set of Boolean equations, and hence the input format differs
slightly from that described in <A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?5+pla">pla</A>(5) (which provides for the <I>physical</I>
representation of a <FONT SIZE="-1">PLA</FONT>).
The input and output formats
have been expanded to allow for multiple-valued logic
functions, and to allow for the specification of the
don't-care set which will be used in the minimization.
<P>

A complete list of the command line options is given below.
Be warned that many of the command line options are not intended
for general use.
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>-d</B>

<DD>
Enables debugging.
Useful only for those familiar with the algorithms used.
<DT><B>-Dcheck</B>

<DD>
Checks that the function is a partition of the
entire space (i.e., that the <FONT SIZE="-1">ON</FONT>-set, <FONT SIZE="-1">OFF</FONT>-set
and <FONT SIZE="-1">DC</FONT>-set are
pairwise disjoint, and that their union is the Universe).

<DT><B>-Dd1merge</B>

<DD>
Performs a quick distance-1 merge on the input
file.  This is useful when the input file
is very large (e.g., a truth table with more than 1000 terms) because
distance-1 merge is O(n log n) rather than the <FONT SIZE="-1">EXPAND</FONT>
step of Espresso which is
O(n * n).  The output should then be run through
Espresso to complete the minimization.  A range of variables to
be merged can also be specified using
<B>-rn-m</B>

(the default is to merge over all variables).

<DT><B>-Decho</B>

<DD>
Echoes the function to standard output.
This can be used to get the complement of a function when
combined with <B>-o</B>.

<DT><B>-Dequiv</B>

<DD>
Identify output variables which are equivalent.  Takes into account
the don't-care set and checks for equivalence of both the <FONT SIZE="-1">ON</FONT>-set
and <FONT SIZE="-1">OFF</FONT>-set.
<DT><B>-Dexact</B>

<DD>
Exact minimization algorithm (guarantees minimum number of
product terms, and heuristically minimizes number of literals).
Potentially expensive.

<DT><B>-Dsignature</B>

<DD>
Signature Cubes based Exact minimization algorithm 
(guarantees minimum number of product terms, and heuristically 
minimizes number of literals).  On an average faster than -Dexact
and solves problems on which -Dexact fails.

<DT><B>-Dmany</B>

<DD>
Reads and minimizes PLA's until end-of-file is detected.  PLA's in
the same file are separated by <I>.e</I>.

<DT><B>-Dmap</B>

<DD>
Draw the Karnaugh maps for a binary-valued function.

<DT><B>-Dmapdc</B>

<DD>
Derive from the binary-valued variable <I>DONT_CARE</I> a don't-care set,
and then delete this variable.
All input conditions for which an output changes when <I>DONT_CARE</I>
changes define the don't-care conditions for that output.
This is a hack to support don't-cares from high-level languages without
a notion of don't-cares.

<DT><B>-Dopo</B>

<DD>
Perform output phase optimization (i.e., determine which
functions to complement to reduce the number of
terms needed to implement the function).  After choosing an
assignment of phases for the outputs, the function is minimized.
A simple algorithm is used which may become very expensive for
a large number of outputs (e.g., more than 40).
<DT><B>-Dopoall</B>

<DD>
Minimize the function with all possible phase assignments.
A range of outputs to cycle through can be given with
<B>-rn-m</B>

(the default is to use all outputs).
The option
<B>-S1</B>

will perform an exact minimization for each phase assignment.
Be warned that opoall requires an exponential number of minimizations !
<DT><B>-Dpair</B>

<DD>
Choose an assignment of the inputs to two-bit decoders, and
minimize the function.  The function MUST be minimized first to
achieve good results.  There are actually 4 different algorithms,
of increasing cost, which may be selected with
<B>-S1</B>,

<B>-S2</B>,

or
<B>-S3</B>.

The default is
<B>-S0</B>

which seems to give the best results for the cost.
<DT><B>-Dpairall</B>

<DD>
Minimize the function with all possible assignments of inputs to
two-bit decoders.
The option
<B>-S1</B>

will perform an exact minimization for each assignment of inputs
to decoders, and the option
<B>-S2</B>

will perform an output-phase assignment for each assignment of
inputs to decoders.
Be warned that pairall requires an exponential number of minimizations !
<DT><B>-Dseparate</B>

<DD>
Remove the don't-care set from the <FONT SIZE="-1">ON</FONT>-set of the function.
<DT><B>-Dso</B>

<DD>
Minimize each function one at a time as a single-output function.
Terms will not be shared among the functions.
The option
<B>-S1</B>

will perform an exact minimization for each single-output function.
<DT><B>-Dso_both</B>

<DD>
Minimize each function one at a time as a single-output function, but
choose the function or its complement based on which has fewer terms.
The option
<B>-S1</B>

will perform an exact minimization for each single-output function and
its complement to determine which has fewer terms.
<DT><B>-Dstats</B>

<DD>
Provide simple statistics on the size of the function.
<DT><B>-Dverify</B>

<DD>
Checks for Boolean equivalence of two PLA's.  Reads two filenames
from the command line, each containing a single PLA.
<DT><B>-DPLAverify</B>

<DD>
Checks for Boolean equivalence of two PLA's by first permuting the
columns based on the user supplied variable names.  Reads two
filenames from the command line.
<DT><B>-eeat</B>

<DD>
Normally comments are echoed from the input file to the output file.
This options discards any comments in the input file.
<DT><B>-efast</B>

<DD>
Stop after the first <FONT SIZE="-1">EXPAND</FONT> and <FONT SIZE="-1">IRREDUNDANT</FONT> operations
(i.e., do not iterate over the solution).
<DT><B>-ekiss</B>

<DD>
Sets up a <I>kiss</I>-style minimization problem.  This is a hack.
<DT><B>-eness</B>

<DD>
Essential primes will not be detected.
<DT><B>-enirr</B>

<DD>
The result will not necessarily be made irredundant in the final step
which removes redundant literals.
<DT><B>-enunwrap</B>

<DD>
The <FONT SIZE="-1">ON</FONT>-set will not be unwrapped before beginning the minimization.
<DT><B>-eonset</B>

<DD>
Recompute the <FONT SIZE="-1">ON</FONT>-set before the minimization.  Useful when the
<FONT SIZE="-1">PLA</FONT> has a large number of product terms (e.g., an exhaustive
list of minterms).
<DT><B>-epos</B>

<DD>
Swaps the <FONT SIZE="-1">ON</FONT>-set and <FONT SIZE="-1">OFF</FONT>-set of the function after
reading the function.  This can be used to minimize the <FONT SIZE="-1">OFF</FONT>-set
of a function.  <I>.phase</I> (see <A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?5+espresso">espresso</A>(5))
in the input file can also specify an arbitrary choice of output phases.
<DT><B>-estrong</B>

<DD>
Uses the alternate strategy <FONT SIZE="-1">SUPER_GASP</FONT> (as a replacement
for <FONT SIZE="-1">LAST_&nbsp;GASP</FONT>) which is
more expensive, but occasionally provides better results.
<DT><B>-o[type]</B>

<DD>
Selects the output format.  By default, only the <FONT SIZE="-1">ON</FONT>-set (i.e.,
type f) is output after the minimization.  [type] can be one of <B>f</B>,
<B>d</B>, <B>r</B>, <B>fd</B>, <B>dr</B>, <B>fr</B>, or <B>fdr</B> to select
any combination of the <FONT SIZE="-1">ON</FONT>-set (f), the <FONT SIZE="-1">OFF</FONT>-set (r) or the
<FONT SIZE="-1">DC</FONT>-set (d).  [type] may also be <B>eqntott</B> to output algebraic
equations acceptable to 
<I>eqntott</I>(1OCTTOOLS),

or <B>pleasure</B> to output an
unmerged <FONT SIZE="-1">PLA</FONT> (with the <I>.label</I> and <I>.group</I> keywords)
acceptable to 
<I>pleasure</I>(1OCTTOOLS).

<DT><B>-s</B>

<DD>
Will provide a short summary of the execution of the program including
the initial cost of the function, the final cost, and the computer
resources used.
<DT><B>-t</B>

<DD>
Will produce a trace showing the execution of the program.  After each
main step of the algorithm, a single line is printed which reports the
processor time used, and the current cost of the function.
<DT><B>-x</B>

<DD>
Suppress printing of the solution.
<DT><B>-v [type]</B>

<DD>
Specifies verbose debugging detail.  Not generally useful.

<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DIAGNOSTICS</H2>

Espresso will issue a warning message
if a product term spans more than one line.  Usually this is an
indication that the number of inputs or outputs of the function
is specified incorrectly.

<H2>COMMENTS</H2>

Default is to pass comments and unrecognized options from the input file
to standard output (sometimes this isn't what you want).
<P>

It is no longer possible to specify the type on the command line.
<P>

There are a lot of options, but typical use doesn't need them.
<P>

This manual page refers to Version 2.4 of Espresso.  The major change from
Version 2.3 to Version 2.4 is the addition of a new exact minimizer based
on signature cubes (-D signature subcommand).
