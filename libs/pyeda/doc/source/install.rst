  Installing PyEDA
********************

This page describes how to procure your very own, shiny copy of PyEDA.
It is a primary goal of the PyEDA project to be a mainstream Python package,
and adhere to the majority of conventions observed by the community.

Supported Platforms
===================

PyEDA supports Windows, and any platform with a C compiler.
The author does development and testing on MacOS and Ubuntu Linux.

Supported Python Versions
=========================

Starting with version ``0.15``, PyEDA will only work with Python 3.2+.
Starting with version ``0.23``, PyEDA will only work with Python 3.3+.
There were several reasons to drop support for Python 2:

* Python 3 is the future of the language.
* Almost all scientific software either has already been ported,
  or is in the process of being ported to Python 3.
* Only Python 3 has support for the ``def f(*args, kw1=val1, ...)`` syntax,
  used to great effect by logic expression factory functions.
* It is too arduous to research and support all the C API changes from version
  2 to version 3. Preprocessor is evil.
* I am quite fond of the new ``yield from ...`` syntax.

Distutils / Virtualenv
======================

The latest PyEDA release is hosted on
`PyPI <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyeda>`_.

To get PyEDA with `pip`_::

   $ pip3 install pyeda

We *strongly* recommend that you also install an excellent Python tool called
`IPython`_.
For interactive use,
it is vastly superior to using the standard Python interpreter.
To install IPython into your virtual environment::

   $ pip3 install ipython

Linux Notes
-----------

If you are using the Linux system distribution of pip,
most likely ``pip`` will be part of Python-2.x, which won't work.
It's safer to always use ``pip3``.

You will probably need to install the Python3 "development" package
to get Python's headers and libraries.
For Debian derivatives (eg Ubuntu), run ``sudo apt-get install python3-dev``.
On RedHat derivatives, run ``sudo yum install python3-devel``.

Windows Notes
-------------

I highly recommend Christophe Gohlke's
`pythonlibs page <http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/>`_
for installing PyEDA on Windows.

If you are using a Windows wheel distribution,
you may need to install the
`Visual Studio 2012 Redistributable <http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=30679>`_

Getting the Source
==================

The PyEDA repository is hosted on `GitHub <https://github.com/cjdrake/pyeda>`_.
If you want the bleeding-edge source code, here is how to get it:

.. code-block:: sh

   $ git clone https://github.com/cjdrake/pyeda.git
   $ cd pyeda
   # $PREFIX is the root of the installation area
   $ python setup.py install --prefix $PREFIX

If you want to build the documentation,
you must have the excellent `Sphinx`_ documentaton system installed.

::

   $ make html

If you want to run the tests,
you must have the excellent `PyTest`_ unit testing framework installed.

::

   $ make test
