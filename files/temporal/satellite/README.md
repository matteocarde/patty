# Satellite (Temporal, Satisficing)

## Domain Description

Planners are asked to collect image data with a number of satellites.
The domain was introduced by Maria Fox and Derek Long in IPC-3.
All (but one) of the IPC-3 domain versions were reused with the exact same suites of instances.
Two of the IPC-3 domain versions were extended with time windows for the sending of the gathered data to earth, which is the most critical aspect of the problem in reality.
